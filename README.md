# ptrt
A simple path-tracing ray-tracer
# Building
You will need meson + ninja:
```bash
pip3 install --upgrade meson
pip3 install --upgrade ninja
```
You will also need OpenMP + Nlohmann-JSON:
```bash
# Debian based distros:
sudo apt install libomp-dev nlohmann-json-dev
# Arch based distros:
sudo pacman -Sy openmp nlohmann-json
# Fedora based distros:
sudo dnf install libomp-devel json-devel
```
To build use the following commands:
```bash
cd ptrt # root of the project
meson builddir
cd builddir
ninja
```
To run the compiled program:
```bash
./ptrt /path/to/scene.json
```

# Credits
Almost all calculation related code comes from these [amazing books from Peter Shirley](https://raytracing.github.io/) but I have added a few optimizations and parallelization to make it run faster.
